# Deciding-Proper-Zooming-Techniques-for-Multilayered-2D-Data-Navigation-Tasks

This project aims to help deciding the proper zooming technique for specific 2D multilayered data navigation tasks like Search, Identify, Count, Compare, Decide, Classify etc.
both for known and unknwon targets. Among different data navigation techniques (Overview & Details, Pan & Zoom), zooming is easy, fast and intuitive among researchers and normal 
people. In this project, 2 different zooming techniques- Interactive and Two Level (independent variables) zooming have been compared on the basis of some standard evaluation 
parameters (dependent variables)- Completion Time, Error Rate, Number of Zooms, Number of Drags and Prefernce.


The data we experimented on was adopted from Google Maps because it is one of the most familiar 2D and multilayered data
visualization interfaces used by a lot of common people around the globe. The Google Maps was the best suited candidate for its
familiarity, ease of access and data visualization characteristics. For understanding the effectiveness of our proposed system, we
ran a pilot study before the main experiment.

# Study Procedeure:
The main study which took about 45 minutes per participant where each participant completed 6 tasks in the practice session. They were given a participant ID 
and briefed about the experiment as well as the system and its goals, followed by the practice session. The practice tasks
were designed to be contextually familiar to the actual experiment tasks. All the queries were answered and confusions were cleared
to them before going into the main experiment.

In the main experiment, there were 2 sessions- each session had 6 tasks to be completed using either Interactive or Two Level zooming. Each task question was displayed before the
task timer started and the related map appeared on the screen. When a participant clicked the ’Start Task’ button, the timer started and the actual question map came up. 
After a participant got the answer, he/she input the answer in a text box below and click ’Next’ to stop the timer and get the next question. This way one
experiment session was chained to the next with a break of 3 minutes in between.

After the experiment, each participated in a survey that contained demographic information, usual feedback on experiment, self assessment and zooming technique preference queries.
They were asked to check one, both, none, or any other technique for the 6 tasks to be preferred in further daily data visualization tasks followed by any extra suggestion to 
offer.

The study was a within participant design with the 2 zooming techniques in a latin square fashion.
